TWITTER SETUP:

**For Eclipse-**
To import the jar file, right click on the project folder
then go to Properties>Java Build Path>Libraries>Add JARs
and locate the twitter4j-core-4.0.7.jar file (in the /lib 
folder of the twitter4j-4.0.7 folder).

**For IntelliJ-**
To import the jar file, click on File in toolbar. Then click project structure, 
click on modules and then click on dependencies. On the right hand side you should
see a '+'. Then choose 'JARs or Directories' from the dropdown. Go into the 
twitter4j-4.0.7 folder and select the twitter4j-core jar from the lib folder. 
Then click ok and click apply.

The classes with the Twitter imports rely on a twitter4j core file and a .properties
file, so errors will occur without these files present.

DO NOT EDIT THE .PROPERTIES FILE
The contents of this file are made specifically to run the tweet feature.
This file was made so that the library can connect to the account and create
the tweet. The randomly generated strings are what specifies our account and 
authorises our code to post to it.
