# CS230-Group_Coursework

For the CS230 Software Engineering module at Swansea University, our randomly assembled group was tasked with developing a 2D retro game using Java and JavaFX. The game is composed of multiple levels (i.e., a collection of maps). A player plays one level at a time and, upon completion of a level, progresses onto the next level. Each level is played on a 2 dimensional map (i.e., grid). 

Each cell of the grid can be of a certain type, for example, a wall, a door, ground (i.e., empty), etc. There is also the player who occupies a cell and various enemies that if touched will kill the player. The player can move by using the arrow keys (up, down, left and right). After the player moves, the screen will be redrawn with the new game state.

We were required to develop the game whilst adhering strictly to a functional specification supplied, but we were also required to think of and develop additional features to advance our game in order to attain higher marks.

For this coursework, I worked extensively with another member of the group in developing software as part of adherence to the pair programming paradigm. My main area of softwae development was for the back-end of game, including building a binary search tree for the searching of profiles saved within the game, as well as developing the file reading and writing system for saving user accounts and loading the maps for the game. I also heavily influenced the development of the front end of the game as well as working tirelessly to motivate other team members to ensure that the coursework was completed on time.
